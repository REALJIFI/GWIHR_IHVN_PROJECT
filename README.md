Project overview:
ASPIRE Project
The footprints of our impact in improving the health care system is indelibly planted across the country where we have worked and currently work in implementing several health programs.
The ACTION to Sustain Precision and Integrated HIV Response towards Epidemic Control (ASPIRE) project that we implement is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC).
The project is currently focused in four states, Nasarawa State, Rivers State, Kastina State, and the Federal Capital Territory. It is aimed at
•	Strengthening laboratory capacity to achieve quality clinical management for HIV and other health challenges.
•	Empowering quality healthcare and a sustainable culture of excellence in HIV management through Continuous Quality Improvement.
•	Increasing the uptake of prevention services, including Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), among those at risk, especially key populations and underserved groups such as adolescents.
•	Strengthening laboratory capacity to achieve quality clinical management for HIV and other health challenges.
•	Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART) for adults and children (including pregnant women)
•	Care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and people affected by HIV/AIDS
•	Monitoring and evaluation of patients and program progress.
•	Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC),
•	Gender-Based Violence (GBV) support services
•	Training in all the above areas.
ASPIRE  project provides the following services in the health facilities we support: HIV Testing Services (HTS), laboratory diagnosis and tracking of status of people living with HIV, prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART) for adult and children (including pregnant women), care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and people affected by HIV/AIDS, monitoring and evaluation of patients and program progress, support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), Gender-Based Violence (GBV) support services and training in all the above areas.

Project challenges:
Challenges for Addressing Patient Treatment Gaps
1. Identifying Patients with Missed Appointments
Challenge: Retrieve a list of HIV patients who have missed their last two ART appointments.
Objective: Identify patients at risk of treatment interruption and follow up for re-engagement.
2. ART Adherence Monitoring
Challenge: Calculate the percentage of ART patients who have collected their medication on time in the last six months.
Objective: Evaluate adherence rates and identify patients needing adherence counselling.
3. Viral Load Suppression Analysis
Challenge: Find all HIV-positive patients who have been on ART for at least 6 months but have a viral load above the suppression threshold (>1000 copies/mL).
Objective: Assess treatment efficacy and identify individuals who may require enhanced adherence support or regimen adjustments.
4. Linkage to Care for Newly Diagnosed Patients
Challenge: Find the percentage of newly diagnosed HIV patients in the past six months who were successfully linked to ART within 30 days of diagnosis.
Objective: Improve linkage rates and ensure timely initiation of treatment.
5. Retention in Care After 12 Months
Challenge: Determine the proportion of patients who started ART 12 months ago and are still actively in care.
Objective: Measure retention rates and identify facilities with high loss-to-follow-up cases.
6. HIV Testing Services (HTS) Performance
Challenge: Compare the number of HIV tests conducted with the number of positive diagnoses.
Objective: Evaluate the efficiency of testing strategies and optimize resource allocation.
